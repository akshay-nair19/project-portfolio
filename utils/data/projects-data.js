Integrated Supabase authentication and row-level security to protect user data, enforce access controls, and ensure safe item transactions. Implemented WebSocket-based real-time private messaging between borrowers and lenders, providing instant communication within the platform. Leveraged OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to deliver AI-powered item recommendations that adapt to academic periods such as midterms and finals. Utilized Supabase PostgreSQL for relational data management and Supabase Storage for secure handling of item and profile images. Built a responsive frontend with React Router, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring fast performance and a clean, intuitive user experience. ',
